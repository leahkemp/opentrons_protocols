# Programming opentrons robot

This script automates a portion of the new [opentrons pipetting robot](https://opentrons.com/) using the [opentrons api (OT-2 API V2)](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html). More specifically, it automates the dilution step (concentration normalisation) after PCR amplification and a picogreen assay in the arctic protocol on all samples above the threshold concentration. It then performs the end-repair and barcoding on all normalized samples. Samples are then consolidated into a single tube.

## Input data

This protocol accepts raw DNA concentration data from the Optima plate reader in .xlsx format. The most recent .xlsx file will be read in from /path/on/robot/ to serve as an entry point to the script. Upload an .xlsx file relating to the samples to run the script.

## Info

- Save plate reader output as a .xlsx file in /path/on/robot/
- The samples will need to be laid out as described in the SARS_SOP.
- Up to 24 samples per run.
- Samples with a concentration < 4ng/ul will be skipped.
- The position of the sample on the plate will determine which barcode is used.
- Columns 1,2 and 3 can contain sample data. Column 4 must contain Pico standards data.

## Simulate protocol

Create and activate a conda environment to get the minimum python version required for a [non-jupyter opentrons installation](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/writing.html#non-jupyter-installation)

```bash
conda env create -f opentrons_env.yml
conda activate opentrons_env
```

Simulate the protocol [from the command line](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/writing.html#from-the-command-line)

```bash
opentrons_simulate normalisation.py
```

## Deck lay out

This protocol requires:

- Tips:
    1. Opentrons 96 filtertips 20ul; Slots 8 and 9
    2. Opentrons 96 filtertips 300ul; Slot 6

- Temperature Module: Slot 10
- 12 well reservoir 22ml: Slot 11
- 24 tube rack for enzymes: Slots 4 and 7
- End repair kit
- Ligation kit
- Barcodes

## Barcodes rack layout

Barcodes are in held in a 24 tube rack in slot 4. The tubes should be laid out as shown below.

|   | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |
|---|------|------|------|------|------|------|

| D | Empty Tube            |                    |            |                      |                    |            |

__Empty tubes are for making master-mixes and collection of the final samples. It is very important these are included or you will lose all the samples and waste the reagents.__
